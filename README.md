# ONLINE SHOPPER'S INTENTION ANALYSIS
### BY COURAGE SIAMEH.

### INTRODUCTION

Online shopping by consumers is increasing every year, but the conversion rates have stayed relatively stable. For instance, many of us explore e-commerce platforms like Amazon, may add things to our wishlists or shopping carts, but ultimately make no purchases. This reality highlights the necessity for tools and strategies that can tailor promotions and ads to online shoppers and enhance conversion rates. This project will explore multiple factors that influence a buyer's decision.


### DATASET

We will be utilizing information from the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset for this project, which is accessible through the UCI repository. The primary dataset can be located at this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset.


### PROJECT MOTIVATION

The motivation behind this project is to address the issue of low conversion rates in e-commerce websites despite the increasing trend of online shopping. The project aims to use data from the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset to analyze various factors that influence a purchaser's decision and explore solutions to improve conversion rates. By customizing promotions and advertisements for online shoppers based on their behavior, preferences, and characteristics, the project aims to improve the overall shopping experience and increase sales for e-commerce websites.
